## Description

Inspired by the live-coding session with LeafLink, this small project encompasses mimicking a design that features a default, expanded and hover state for a user profile card. The contents within the card comes from a public API endpoint and provides certain user information such as name, title, profile image, followers, comments and ratings.

## Run It!

In order to run the project locally simply install the node modules, which only depends on the local-web-server package.

```bash
npm install
```

After modules are installed you can run the start script as seen in package.json

```bash
npm start

```
This defines the local host name and port as `127.0.0.1:7070` but feel free to change any of the values set up in that particular line.
